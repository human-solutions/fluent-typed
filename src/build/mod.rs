///
/// ```no_run
/// // in build.rs
/// fn main() -> std::process::ExitCode {
///    let options = fluent_typed::BuildOptions::default();
///    fluent_typed::build_from_locales_folder(options)

///
/// ```toml
/// # in Cargo.toml
/// [dependencies]
/// fluent-typed = 0.1
///
/// [build-dependencies]
/// fluent-typed = { version = "0.1", features = ["build"] }
/// ```

/// not present in all locales, as well as for messages with different signatures.
///
/// It is recommended to generate the rust code to the output_file_path "src/l10n.rs" and include
/// it in the project, so that you get warnings for unused translation messages.
///
/// See [BuildOptions] for more configuration options.
